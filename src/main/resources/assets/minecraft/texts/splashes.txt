we take no responsibility for lost brain cells
now with 110% more chaos!
if you hear screaming its probably just the code
its not too late to back out
if you find herobrine, you didnt
sanity is overrated anyway
why are you still reading these
just added 10 mobs, we dont know what they do either
probably has more bugs than your house
did we mention there's 5 amoguses?
this mod ate my homework
may contain traces of actual logic (jk)
insert random keyboard smash here
expect the unexpected
dont press half your keyboard ig?
if you can explain this mod, you get a cookie (its prob poisoned)
your skills wont save you here buddy
we're pretty sure this mod is sentient
if life gives you lemons, add them to this mod (maybe they'll explode)
we didnt break minecraft, we just remodeled it... with sledgehammers
dont ask me why there are 5 amoguses, i dont know either
run while you can
are you sure you want to do this?
welcome to the fever dream you didnt know you needed
if "wtf" is your main reaction, we've succeeded
your therapist has been warned
we're not responsible for any sudden urges to throw your computer out the window.
the only thing more chaotic than this mod is our code
is this a mod or a social experiment? we're not sure
loading...or are we just pretending to load?
this mod is the reason aliens havent contacted us yet
we're not saying the mod is broken, but it might be possessed
loading.. please sacrifice a goat to appeal to the code gods
logic, whats that?
