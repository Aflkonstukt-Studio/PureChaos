## About

pure-chaos is the MCreator-based component of the PureChaos mod. It contains various elements like dimensions, biomes, items, and other features created using the MCreator GUI.

## Development

### Requirements

- Current MCreator Version: 2025.1
- Required plugins are located in the [.plugins folder](https://github.com/Aflkonstukt-Studio/PureChaos/tree/master/pure-chaos/.plugins)
  - To use them, copy them into your MCreator plugins folder

### Getting Started

1. Install MCreator 2025.1
2. Install the required plugins and enable Java plugins in MCreator
3. Open the project in MCreator
4. Make changes to mod elements via the MCreator GUI

### Important Notes

- Changes made in MCreator will impact the generated code
- Do not manually edit the MCreator-generated code files
- For custom code implementations, use the `pure-spice` project instead

## Integration

## Features

This component includes:
- Custom dimensions
